													    <br /><br />
													    An crowd funding action is determined through a minimum amount of capital which is going to be leveraged 
													    before the action starts.<br />
													    In comparison to the minimum amount of capital, every crowdfunder only refinanzes a small part.
													  	<br/><br />
													  	The crowdfunder recieves a consideration for his investment, which can have diffrent forms (eg rights, 
													  	money, non-cash benefits) but always has a monetary value.
													  	<br /><br />
													  	The communication between lenders and borrowers will be implemented on a platform of Web 2.0, or by email.
													  	<br /><br />
													  	A further characterizing feature of crowd funding is that the generated money is appropriated to that action.
